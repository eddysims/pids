Pids theming is done through CSS and CSS custom properties.

Custom properties have a specific structure that is inspired by BEM (Block Element Modifier).

## Global Styles

Global styles are styles defined in `@pids/styles` and are added to the project. These properties are not meant to be associated with any components.

A few examples of this are `color`, `space`, `font-size`, etc.

These global styles follow the pattern of:

```
`pids` -- `namespace` -- `property` -- `modifier`
```

A few examples of this are as follows:

```css
--pids--space--base
--pids--space--large
```

With a modifier:

```css
--pids--color--background
--pids--color--grey
--pids--color--grey--lightest
```

## Themeing components

Components have a little more of a challenge as the variants grow. The custom properties should follow a structure such as:

```
`pids` -- `component` -- `property` -- `modifier` -- `value`
```

A few examples of this are:

```css
--pids--button--background-color
--pids--heading--font-size
```

with a modifier

```css
--pids--button--background-color--variant--ghost
--pids--heading--font-size--as--h1
```
